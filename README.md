# Nanopore barcode binner

__THIS TOOL IS DEPRECATED!__ I've added barcode demultiplexing to [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), so any further development will happen there, not here. If Porechop doesn't do what you need for barcode binning, post it on [Porechop's issues page](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop/issues).
